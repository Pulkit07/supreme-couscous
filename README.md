An online portal where students can share the problems which they are facing, can conduct surveys to represent that a change is needed, so that these complaints and problems can be readdressed by university as soon as possible.

# A word about what we are trying to do.

We here are trying to develop a web application for students of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University where they can share their problems, views on others problems, can conduct surveys and more related things.

This is being done so that we can have a platform where people can share their problems or complaints and can be readdressed by the university administration quickly.

Things we have decided to implement:

1) Singup using only university's email ID.
2) Functionality to submit a problem or a complaint.
3) Reactions on problems like 'I have faced this one', 'I know about this one but didn't faced' and more.
4) Functionality to submit surveys to be conducted.
5) Allow problems to be submitted anonymously.
6) User dashboard to update their profile.

We are using Django and Postgres to help us out. For the frontend we are just using Bootstrap but if you want to contribute for the same by using something else, feel free to make a pull request. You are welcome to make a pull request for any kind of improvement.
